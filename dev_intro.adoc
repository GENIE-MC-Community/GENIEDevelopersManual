GENIE <<Andreopoulos:2009rq>> is a neutrino event generator created to be the 
``universal event generator'' requested during the NuINT conference series. It was 
designed to provide an accessible, extensible framework with many convenience 
tools leveraging existing HEP software like Pythia <<Sjostrand:2006za>>, 
ROOT <<Brun:1997pa>>, and LHAPDF <<Whalley:2005nh>>.
