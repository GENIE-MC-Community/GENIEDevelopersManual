Running the Code: The CCQE Walkthrough
--------------------------------------
[[CCQE-Walkthrough]]

This section assumes you have a cross section spline and have tested the steps outlined
in <<Running-GENIE-Basics>>.

Setting up Breakpoints in Advance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following breaks can be very useful for understanding the flow control, and 
are valid in the frozen release v2-8-0. Put these commands in a file named 
+.gdbinit+ in the directory where you will run GENIE. If you cloned the supporting
document repository from <<How-To>>, you may copy +gdbinit_ccqels+ into your +.gdbinit+
file to get these breakpoints and functions.

WARNING: You may also place +.gdbinit+ in your +\$HOME+ directory, but this sets 
values for all instances of +gdb+ globally.

---------------------------

Of course, these breakpoints are fragile if you are changing the source code 
because they rely on line numbers. You may also use function names to make a 
more generic ``starting'' +.gdbinit+ file (they may not always work though, 
while line numbers are reliable).

It is important to understand some of GENIE's design patterns 
<<wikidesignpatterns>>, <<wikigof>> when stepping through framework code. 
GENIE makes 
heavy use of the Singleton Pattern, Visitor Pattern, and Chain of Responsibility 
Pattern <<gof>>. The Singleton Pattern restricts object creation for a given class 
to one and only one instance. The Visitor Pattern separates an algorithm from an 
object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object. The Chain of 
Responsibility Pattern delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.

These patterns are how you see pointers on the stack accessing global data, and 
why sometimes loops over vectors of generic classes calling the same method over 
and over are able to process such a wide variety of behaviors with very compact 
code.

Don't worry overly much about the patterns in the main framework. Stepping through 
them with `gdb` will make their operation clear in any case.

Feel free to explore more along the way and step into whatever you like. It is always
okay to set a break point just after the function you step into so you leap out with 
a continue at any time.

First,

  gdb -tui gevgen

Then, at the `gdb` prompt,

  set args -n 5 -p 14 -t 1000060120 -e 3 --run 100 \
  --seed 2989819 \
  --cross-sections /minerva/app/users/perdue/GENIE/data/ccqe_carbon_splines.xml \
  --event-generator-list CCQE

It is convenient to simply copy and paste these lines. Note that we use ``\'' to 
break the line (the whole command needs to be on one line). You should use the 
correct path to your spline file. Then,

  run

Or just `r`. Try to solve all of the exercises below. Note that you may not have
the complete set of tools the first time through, or you may come to a conclusion 
and then change your mind later after you learn more about GENIE and how to investigate
with `gdb`. Now, for the walkthrough:

[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|======================================================
|n       |  1. We were automatically set to break on `main`. Move past `GetCommandLineArgs`...
|s       |  2. Step into `Initialize`. You may need to `ctrl-l` in order to clear logging 
text - keep this in mind going forward! If the screen gets cluttered with logging text 
(`gdb` does not redraw cleverly), use `ctrl-l` to get an understandable screen.
|b 237   |  3. Set a breakpoint at the end of this function. We'll test it shortly.
|inf b   |  4. Note the number of the breakpoint you just set.
|Exercise|  5. What is the `RunOpt::Instance()`? What pattern does it employ? Use `s` and `n` 
to drill down into the code.
|n       |  6. Step down to `XSecTable` (line 233). (You will need to press `n` more than 
once, etc.)
|s       |  7. Step into `XSecTable`. 
|Exercise|  8. Try to figure out what is going on in this function. Step into anything you 
need to. Experiment with `fin` to step out (and back up into XSecTable).
|c       |  9. ``Continue'' once you are satisfied in XSecTable. You should end up on line 
237 of gEvGen.cxx back where we just set our breakpoint. 
|del #   | 10. Delete the breakpoint we set (we won't need it any longer).
|inf b   | 11. Verify the breakpoint is gone.
|n       | 12. Step back into main. You only need to press `n` once; after that you may simply 
keep pressing `enter`.
|n       | 13. Step down to `GenerateEventsAtFixedInitState` (line 221).
|s       | 14. Step into `GenerateEventsAtFixedInitState`.
|n       | 15. Step down over these functions down to the break at line 274. 
Try stepping a couple of times with `n`, and use `c` to continue to 274 if you're in a 
hurry. There are many 
important things happening along the way here for setting up the run. For the 
purposes of understanding model development, we'll skip them for now. 
(They are important for understanding the GENIE _framework_ though.)
Depending on your interests, you may want to go ahead and step through the 
instantiation of the `InitialState` to get a quick sense for what is happening
there.
|Note    | 16. From this point, it is understood you need to use `n` to step through from 
one instruction to the next where appropriate. We will be causual with its use.
|s       | 17. Step into `GenerateEvent` (274). We have a break at that line, so if you
are ``far away,'' you may press `c` to continue to that line. 
|b 276   | 18. We don't want to accidently go past line 276.
|s       | 19. Walk down through `GenerateEvent` and step into `SelectInteraction` 
at the breakpoint we just set (GEVGDriver.cxx:276).
|b 178   | 20. We have now stepped into `PhysInteractionSelector::SelectInteraction`.
Set a breakpoint on line 178.
|b 214   | 21. Set a breakpoint on line 214.
|Exercise| 22. Walk through the code in this method and find out the names of the cross 
section algorithms as they are loaded. You will need to use the `gdb` print command 
and may need to dereference the variable if it is a pointer.
|Exercise| 23. When you get to line 178, print the size of the `xseclist`. Remember you 
can tab-complete variable names and even methods! Then you may delete the breakpoint. 
(But you aren't obligated to.)
|Exercise| 24. When you get to line 214, try the following commands (first, recall that
`ctrl-x o` will switch the focus between the code and command windows of `gdb` while 
in TUI mode - this will enable us to press ``up'' to go back through command history): 
`p  evrec`, 
`p  *evrec`, 
`p *(evrec->fInteraction)`, 
`p *(evrec->fInteraction->fProcInfo)`, and 
`p  evrec->fInteraction->fProcInfo->fScatteringType`. 
Be careful about when we are 
and aren't dereferencing a pointer. (Tab completion may not work once you're 
several methods deep in that chain.) What do these commands show you? Are you processing
a QuasiElastic event? If not, make sure you followed the steps at the beginning of 
this section and in <<Running-GENIE-Basics>> correctly. Finally, you may delete the 
breakpoint.
|Note    | 25. We just learned some nice tricks for inspecting objects on the heap!
|n       | 26. Continue stepping through the program until you reach line 322 of 
GEVGDriver.cxx. 
|s       | 27. Step into `ProcessEventRecord` on line 322.
|n       | 28. Walk down to our breakpoint on line 107.
|Exercise| 29. Hitting the breakpoint should trigger a print statement. What is the 
information it is telling us?
|c       | 30. Continue to the breakpoint on line 118. Step into the function if you would 
like to see what is happening, otherwise, continue.
|Exercise| 31. Later, return to and study these algorithms we're skipping now. What do they
do? 
|c       | 32. Continute again to the breakpoint on line 107. What is the name of the 
algorithm being processed now.
|c       | 33. Keep pressing `c` until the break on line 107 tells us the active algorithm
is `QELKinematicsGenerator`. Then press `c` again to get to line 118.
|s       | 34. Step into the Kinematics generator.
|n       | 35. Walk down to the breakpoint on line 116.
|Exercise| 36. What are the Q-squared limits for this event?
|s       | 37. Step in at the breakpoint on line 116.
|Exercise| 38. We end up in `KineGeneratorWithCache::MaxXSec`. Based purely on the class
name, what do you think this class does. What does the method do?
|c       | 39. Continue to the breakpoint on line 78.
|Exercise| 40. Step into `FindMaxXSec` (on line 78). What does this function do? When you're 
satisfied, type `fin` to exit the funciton.
|inf b   | 41. What is the number of the breakpoint we just crossed?
|dis #   | 42. _Disable_ the breakpoint we just crossed by number.
|c       | 43. Continue to the breakpoint on line 83.
|s       | 44. Step into `ComputeMaxXSec`. Then, walk down to the breakpoint on line 499.
|Exercise| 45. What is going on in this function? How are we computing the maximum cross 
section?
|s       | 46. Step into the breakpoint on line 499. We are now in the `XSec` funciton.
Walk down to the breakpoint on line 82.
|s       | 47. Step into the breakpoint on line 82.
|Exercise| 48. We are now in `QELFormFactors::Calculate`. What do the functions here do?
How are the form factors organized? Step into whichever functions look interesting 
to you. It might be good to set a breakpoint on line 68 so you can hop out quickly
if you dig deep. Alternatively, you might want to use the `fin` command to hop out 
functions. 
|Note    | 49. If you use `fin`, `gdb` may set temporary helper breakpoints. Don't worry,
it will clean them up. 
|n       | 50. When you get back into `LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec::XSec`, keep walking through 
the function and watch what is happening. When we hit the breakpoint on line 114,
note the cross section. Walk the rest of the way out of the function.
|disable | 51. When we get back into `QELKinematicsGenerator::ComputeMaxXSec`, disable 
_all_ breakpoints.
|u       | 52. Walk through the rest of the for loop, but when you reach line 496, use 
`until`, or just `u` to finish the loop rather than stepping through it again. 
(Although you should feel to step through it again to watch what happens and make
sure you understand what is going on.)
|enable  | 53. Now turn all breakpoints back on.
|n       | 54. Keep walking and note what happens next in `KineGeneratorWithCache::MaxXSec`.
|n       | 55. Once we get back to `QELKinematicsGenerator::ProcessEventRecord`, keep walking.
|Exercise| 56. By what mechanism do we finally accept a cross section value? Note that while
walking through, we will end up stopping at our breakpoints inside `LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec::XSec`.
Use `info b` to figure out their number, or look at the number `gdb` reports and `disable` 
them (unless you want to watch them). 
|c       | 57. Once you are satisfied with mechanics of how we accept a cross section, 
continue to the breakpoint on line 193.
|n       | 58. Walk through the rest of the function and note what is going on. What happens
between lines 230 and 234? `fin` when you are satisfied.
|c       | 59. We are now in `EventGenerator::ProcessEventRecord` again. Continue to the 
breakpoint on line 107. What is the next algorithm we will process? Step through it if you are 
interested.
|c       | 60. Continue until we are alerted the next algorithm is `QELHadronicSystemGenerator`.
Continue again and step into the breakpoint on line 118.
|s       | 61. Inside `QELHadronicSystemGenerator::ProcessEventRecord`, step into 
`AddRecoilBaryon`.
Walk through that function and back out to `EventGenerator::ProcessEventRecord`. Continue 
again to the breakpoint on line 107. Keep continuing and noting the names of the algorithms
we're walking past. Step into any that look interesting.
|Exercise| 62. Check out what is going on in `NucDeExcitationSim`. Can you figure out what the 
most important element is in the far detector of the oscillation experiment that Costas 
happens to belong to?
|n       | 63. After the algorithm loop, continue to the breakpoint on line 195 and walk out 
the method, or use `fin` to get out. (The breakpoint on 195 is mostly to guard against 
over-zealous continuing in the algorithm loop.)
|n       | 64. Back in `GEVGDriver::GenerateEvent`, keep walking and observing. Walk all the 
way until we end up in `GenerateEventsAtFixedInitState` in +gEvGen.cxx+. Keep walking until
we return to the top of the while loop on line 269. Feel free to step into anything 
interesting along the way.
|Congratulations! | 65. We finished a walthrough of one event.
|disable | 66. Disable all breakpoints.
|c       | 67. Continue to the end. There are no breakpoints, so this will end the program.
|r       | 68. You may press `r` at any time to re-run. You may even do this while the 
program is
running. In fact, a common (if somewhat unstable) situation is to find a bug while stepping
through code, fix it, _recompile_, and then press `r` to restart. You do not need to exit 
`gdb` in this case! This way your current breakpoints, etc. are preserved. 
|======================================================

Where did the long list of algorithms we stepped through come from?
For CCQE, the classes that process the event can be found and specified in 
+config/EventGenerator.xml+:

--------------------

One very important feature of this approach is that these classes can be swapped or 
re-ordered. Of course, re-ordering these specific classes might break the event, but nothing
in GENIE forces us to handle the target first or the final-state lepton second, etc. 
We can sequence the appropriate set of computations as required by the physics and we can 
even make some changes dynamically (without recompiling).
