General Issues in Model Development
-----------------------------------
[[General-Issues]]

There are a number of conventions for organizing details of the model. Developers
should strive to implement their code in accordance with these conventions to 
promote maintainability. 

.Conventions for Organization
. Developers should be aware of the +Utils/KineUtils+ class. This class collects
kinematic limits and methods, for example, channel specific (QEL vs Coherent, etc.) 
limits on latexmath:[Q^2], latexmath:[W], and others as well as methods for variable
transformations, etc.
. The +Interaction/KPhaseSpace+ class collects kinematic limits in from +KineUtils+ and
offers them through a more generic interface in addition to making calculations as 
to whether the required phase space is available for a reaction to occur (for example, 
is there enough energy to produce all the final state particles, etc.).
